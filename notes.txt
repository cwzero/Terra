To Do:
- Smart Search, look for common terms, decide how deep to go
- Search for multiple slugs at the same time!
- Separate search technique, isolate it in its own module
- Cache server, maybe with compression
- Concurrent cache levels, store pages of data
- HTML parsing for slug->id?
- Asynchronous Searching - search threads, threads waiting for response
- Only run through pages once
- Need manual entry, separate list for things that need to be added to manual
- Manual as read-only/append
